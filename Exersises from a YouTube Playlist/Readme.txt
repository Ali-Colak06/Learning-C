These are C practice examples I found on YouTube from the playlist: "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1FTfKBAEX6dPcQitk_7uL3OwDdjMn90"
to improve myself in the C language. For each exercise, I first write the code myself, then 
look at the solution in the video to try and gain different perspectives.
