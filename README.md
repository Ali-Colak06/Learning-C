## ðŸŽ¯ About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal log of my progress in learning the C programming language.

My learning method is simple:
1.  I find exercises from various resources (books, websites, etc.).
2.  I try to solve them on my own first.
3.  Then, I review the original solution to compare approaches and broaden my problem-solving perspective.

The goal is not just to find the right answer, but to understand different ways of thinking and writing cleaner, more efficient code.
